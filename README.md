### How It Works

**Description**
The requests and tests are written using the the postman tool (https://www.postman.com/), the tests are written in JavaScript using the postman API, the assertion syntax is similar to mocha or chai. The postman collection and environment can be viewed in postman's browser portal, desktop app, or in the raw JSON formatted file using any viewer. As per the requirements provided this repository uses a docker image of newman/postman to run the tests and requests in the collection, the scripts for this can be found in .gitlab-ci.yml. This file manages and directs the pipeline which can be found in the CI/CD tab. The job can be view under CI/CD -> Jobs.
